# SQL Data Analysis Challenge

## Project Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the SQL Data Analysis Challenge, a project that required me to apply SQL queries to extract and analyze data from a provided dataset. The challenge consisted of several tasks, each designed to test different aspects of SQL, ranging from basic data retrieval to complex aggregations and joins.

## Challenge Tasks
The challenge was structured around the following key tasks:
1. Create tables for customers, orders, and sales data.
2. Calculate total sales, both overall and by category.
3. Find the maximum and minimum sales values.
4. Compute the total profit by category.
5. Determine the average discount by subcategory and list the top three by discount value.
6. Show total sales by region.
7. Identify product details for a specific order ID.
8. Find the subcategory with the highest sales.
9. Count the total number of orders by year.
10. List the top 10 customers who purchased the most furniture.

## Repository Structure
- `Rafiqul Alam - SQL Challenge.sql`: This SQL script contains all the queries used to analyze the data and find answers to the challenge questions.

## How to Use
To run these queries, you will need access to an SQL server where you can create tables and execute queries. The steps are as follows:
1. Clone this repository or download the `SQL-Challenge.sql` file.
2. Import the SQL script into your preferred SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
3. Execute the queries in your SQL client to view the results.
